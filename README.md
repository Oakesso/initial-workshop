Step 0
Step 1
Step 2
Step 3
Step 4
GIT basics
If needed, use the provided cheat-sheet and your best friend google to complete this step.

…You can learn more about GIT here :)

Then use git commands you’ve just learned to :

A) Clone the course repo
Navigate in folder ironhack created during step 1
Clone the course repository (used during the full bootcamp)
Your ironhack/ folder should now look like this:
(my-)documents/
ironhack/
my-code/
cohort-124/
Every day :
You will work in my-code while practicing !
You will pull in cohort-124 and get the updated course contents !

B) Create your first repository
Create a new git repository on your github account
Initialize a local git repository in the initial-workshop/ folder you already created.
Note: Be sure to be located in initial-workshop/ when you initialize your git repo.

Check the repo status in your terminal
Add index.html to stage
Commit with an explicit message
Check the repo status
Push to remote repo
note: you must link your local repo to the remote repo before pushing !

Reiterate the previous operations for styles.css
Then reiterate for image folder
Check your remote repo
Done ? Congratulations !
Mark the time of completion in the spreadsheet.

Copy / paste the link to your remote repository for teacher’s validation.

Then proceed to the next step :)
